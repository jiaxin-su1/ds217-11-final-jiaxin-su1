    "\n",
    "1. **Select target variable** - Choose a meaningful numeric variable to predict\n",
    "2. **Select features** - Exclude target, non-numeric columns, and any features derived from the target (to avoid data leakage)\n",
    "3. **Handle categorical variables** - One-hot encode if needed\n",
    "4. **Perform temporal train/test split** - Sort by datetime, then split by index position (earlier data for training, later for testing)\n",
    "5. **Save artifacts** - Save X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test as separate CSVs\n",
    "6. **Document split** - Record split sizes, date ranges, and feature count\n",

    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting features for modeling, think critically about each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Red Flags to Watch For:**\n",
    "- **Circular logic**: Does this feature use the target variable to predict the target?\n",
    "  - Example: Rolling mean of target, lag of target (if not handled carefully)\n",
    "  - Example: If predicting `Air Temperature`, using `air_temp_rolling_7h` is circular - you're predicting temperature from smoothed temperature\n",
    "- **Data leakage**: Does this feature contain information that wouldn't be available at prediction time?\n",
    "  - Example: Future values, aggregated statistics that include the current value\n",
    "- **Near-duplicates**: Is this feature nearly identical to the target?\n",
    "  - Check correlations - if correlation > 0.95, investigate whether it's legitimate\n",
    "  - Example: A feature with 99%+ correlation with the target is likely problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Practices:**\n",
    "- Use external predictors (other weather variables, temporal features)\n",
    "- Create rolling windows of **predictors**, not the target\n",
    "  - Good: `wind_speed_rolling_7h`, `humidity_rolling_24h`\n",
    "  - Bad: `air_temp_rolling_7h` when predicting Air Temperature\n",
    "- Use derived features that combine multiple predictors\n",
    "- Think: \"Would I have this information when making a real prediction?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** The goal is to predict the target from **other** information, not from the target itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target variable:** What do you want to predict? Temperature? Water conditions? Choose something meaningful and measurable.\n",
    "- **Temporal split:** **CRITICAL** - Use temporal split (earlier data for training, later data for testing), NOT random split. Why? Time series data has temporal dependencies. Typical split: 80/20 or 70/30.\n",
    "- **Feature selection:** Which features are most relevant? Consider correlations, domain knowledge, and feature importance from previous analysis.\n",
    "- **Categorical encoding:** If you have categorical variables, encode them (one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.) before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "After Q6, you should have:\n",
    "- [ ] Temporal train/test split completed (earlier → train, later → test)\n",
    "- [ ] Features prepared (no target, no datetime index)\n",
    "- [ ] Categorical variables encoded\n",
    "- [ ] No data leakage verified\n",
    "- [ ] All 5 artifacts saved: `q6_X_train.csv`, `q6_X_test.csv`, `q6_y_train.csv`, `q6_y_test.csv`, `q6_train_test_info.txt`\n",
